# pixelrpg1

My first attempt at a 2d-pixel rpg'esque game project that also incorporates web3 using Moralis. Is it a huge endeavor for my first project when I'm still learning the essentials of web development and will most likely fail (miserably I might add)? YES! But am I gonna try it anyway? ABSO-FKING-LUTELY!

I got nothing better to do. And I'm aiming for that Avalanche x Moralis Hackathon price woot-woot.
